        Right Now the Main Issue is We are setting up the NFT Worth Manually so
        But on production we will nbe doing it via chainlink data feed for floor
        price of NFT
      </p>
      <p>
        So to liquidate the NFT we need a live price checker of NFT which is abscent right now but we still wrote logic for it so the implmentation is not shown
      </p>
    </div>
